Add sealant on top of the paint to keep the compound and paint from chipping.</i>

  <h3> 3) Pencil Holder</h3>
  <i>First, cut the pieces of felt for the inside and outside of the soup can.Cut it a little smaller so it will fit flat inside the can. Cut the ribbon to the perimeter of the soup can. <br> Then, using hot glue, add a little glue to the can and attach the felt around the can. Add hot glue as you go. Let cool for a few minutes.Now,add the circle to the inside of the tin can. Add hot glue behind the felt.Then using the hot glue, add the ribbon around the top edge of the can covering the top part of the felt. And add enough hot glue to help the ribbon lay flat. Let cool. <br> Now, it's time to add the felt to the inside of the can. First, take the felt and roll it with the backside out to add to the inside of the can. Add some hot glue to the ribbon top and on the sides as you adhere the inside felt pens side out to the inside of the can.To add the pink ribbon at the bottom, waited for the felt to dry so you could handle it.

  <h3> 4) Lantern </h3>
  <i>You can turn your can into a lantern, simply by punching holes in patterns of your choice on the can and fitting a candle or an economic light bulb inside it. When the light disperses through the punched holes, making the can look like a delicate and pretty lamp. You could either hang this or use it as the shade of your table lamp. <br> This idea can save a lot of money spent on electricity and energy.</i>

  <h3> 5) Bird feeder</h3>
  <i> All you must do is poke holes near the top of the can big enough for string or wire to poke through, then fill it with birdseed and hang it from a tree or fence. Alternatively, take any number of empty cans and secure them to a wooden board to create a multiple bird feeder. You’ll have starlings, robins and sparrows gracing your outdoor space in no time.</i>

Spray paint -Used an enamel white and one in yellow. Let them dry completely. <br> Find a draw pull that would work for a center.Slip petal onto screw back of pull I then hammered an aluminum pole flat on the end and drilled a hole in it to secure the draw pull and added the bolt.</i>

    <ol><h4> Follow these simple steps:</h4>
    <li>Preparing the Cans.Start by drinking or draining two aluminum soda cans and popping off the tab on top.Then rinse them out with running water so they're not sticky on the inside. </li> <li>Pop a hole in the bottom of both cans using some sharp scissors or a hammer and nail.</li> <li>Using scissors cut a hole near the top of the can and continue cutting until the entire top is off, making sure to not cut anywhere below where the can begins to narrow. It doesn't matter if the cut is pretty or not. </li> <li>Cutting the Can Into Strips. </li> <li> Cut off the excess metal from the top of the strips where it originally narrowed and try to get them as straight as possible.Then using pliers or your hands fold the top of the strip back onto itself about 1/4 </li> <li>Taking two strips right next to the other overlap one onto the other so it's underneath the flap and it creates a right angle. </li> <li>Keep connecting and folding each strip in the same direction until every strip is married to another. </li> <li>Pull a piece of wire through the two holes of the cans bottoms and wrap a button or beads around it so it doesn't slip off .</li>
